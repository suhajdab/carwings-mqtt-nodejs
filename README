# Carwings MQTT API built in nodejs

This code is meant for interacting with the Nissan Leaf Carwings API. This API allows one to receive updates a swath of information about the vehicle, some of it cached in the cloud and some pulled directly from the vehicle over its cellular connectivity. The API also allows modifying a limited set of vehicle states (AC on/off).
